#Final Project
##United.com Redesign

For this project I wanted to incorporate the skills in branding and design I’ve learned in this class with United Airlines’ existing brand to better showcase that brand on the website. The brand promise is “user friendly” and the existing website did not reflect that quality. 

My plan was to simplify the home page so that the most important functions are easiest to access, making the experience as intuitive and user-friendly as possible, and create a better contact page for the client, creating a space to solve problems rather than fuel them. 
The pages I wanted focus on were the home page, flight booking, flight changes and check-ins, United’s Mileage Plus program, and the Contact Us page
I also wanted revise the company’s voice and tone, improving communication with the customer as they receive the same service in the air, on the ground, online or over the phone, as well as improve the social media footprint 


I began with sketching a responsive environment for the site, which was so important to the process as I had different plans for the mobile experience and the desktop experience, to give a better experience for customers on the go. 

I then moved on to wireframing my top sketches to develop the informational architecture of the site, and create the general layout of each page. 

Next I began researching the history of the website along with my target brand and audience to help me with creating the styling for the site. I created 3 style tiles that proposed color, typography, iconography, texture, and the company's logo.

Once I’d settled on my top wireframe and style tile, I created the full Photoshop Comp of the home page, Implementing style and content into the layout for the wireframe. Now it was time to execute what I had created.

I began coding the site using a mobile first approach to create a fluid responsive environment. I wanted the functions that the user needed most to be the most accessible, in terms of visual design and the location on the page. 

Once the home page was complete I moved on to the advanced versions of some of the homepage functions, such as a much more advanced flight planner, and a more welcoming and accessible flight check in system. 

Next I worked on the frequent flyer section of site, a service called MileagePlus. The existing site did not provide much easy-to-access information on the program, so with the use of visual hierarchy and iconography I better showcased the product for the company. 

After that came the contact page. With this page I wanted to give the customer several different ways of contacting the company, as different issues warrant different methods of contact. I also created a section showcasing common problems, as to solve many problems immediately for the customer.

Overall, the site received a much needed facelift. I established visual hierarchy and better design principles to create a much better experience for the busy, fast environment of its’ users.
